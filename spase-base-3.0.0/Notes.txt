Missing in Simulation Extensions
- Not Defined:
   2DCuts
   3DCubes
   Lines
   Spectra
   SpatialSeries
   Planet
   TestParticle
   Yes
   No
   Test_Particle
   CutsDescription
   CubesDescription
   
- Change "Test_Particle" to "TestParticle" to be consistent with naming convention.

- Use of CutsDescription and CubesDescription was changed slightly in schema. They were defined as a <Choice>, but the new JSON representation does not support this feature of XML so it was changed for each to be optional.

- Favored the Simulation Extensions definition of Granule.
