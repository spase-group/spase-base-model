1.2.1	1.1.0	Container	An element that is a container of other elements. If "Container" is specified the element must have sub-elements specified. When a container element is used no value is assigned to the element. All values are contained within the sub-elements.
1.2.1	1.1.0	Count	An element that has a value which is a whole number.
1.2.1	1.1.0	DateTime	An element that has a value which is a date. A date is given in the ISO 8601 recommended primary standard notation: YYYY-MM-DD. where YYYY is the year in the usual Gregorian calendar, MM is the month of the year between 01 (January) and 12 (December), and DD is the day of the month between 01 and 31. It may also have an optional time portion given in the ISO 8601 recommended primary standard notation: HH:MM:SS.sss where HH is the number of complete hours that have passed since midnight (00-24), MM is the number of complete minutes that have passed since the start of the hour (00-59), and SS is the number of complete seconds since the start of the minute (00-60), and sss are milliseconds that have passed since the start of the second (000-999). Time zones are not allowed so all times are in Universal Time. The time portion must follow the date portion with both portions separated by a "T". For example, "2004-07-29" is July 29, 2004 and "2004-07-29T12:30:00" is precisely 12:30 on July 29, 2004.

A time value given in the ISO 8601 recommended primary standard notation: PTHH:MM:SS.sss where PT are tokens to indicate that the time value is a duration, HH is the number of complete hours that have passed since midnight (00-24), MM  is the number of complete minutes that have passed since the start of the hour (00-59), and SS is the number of complete seconds since the start of the minute (00-60), and sss are milliseconds that have passed since the start of the second (000-999).
