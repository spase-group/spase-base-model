Managing the SPASE data model database.

All database operations are performed with SQL commands.
To run an SQL command first set the default directory to 
the one containing the SQL scripts then login to the 
MySQL database server.

%> cd tools/database
%> mysql -p

And switch to the "spase" database:

mysql> use spase

Then perform one of the following tasks.

Loading data into the database, clearing existing definitions first.
Note: You need to edit "clearversion.sql" to make sure it operates on
      the right version.
      
mysql> source clearversion.sql;
mysql> source dataload.sql;

To create the database and tables:

mysql> source CreateDatabase.sql;

To grant access rights to extra locations/services.

mysql> source grant.sql;

To truncate the contents of all tables:

mysql> TruncateTables.sql;
