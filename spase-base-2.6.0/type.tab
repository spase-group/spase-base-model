#Version	Since	Type	Description
2.6.0	2.6.0	Boundary	Parameters that define a region in space.
2.6.0	1.1.0	Container	A container of other elements. If "Container" is specified the element must have sub-elements specified.
2.6.0	1.1.0	Count	A whole number.
2.6.0	1.1.0	DateTime	A value is given in the ISO 8601 recommended primary standard notation: YYYY-MM-DD. where YYYY is the year in the usual Gregorian calendar, MM is the month of the year between 01 (January) and 12 (December), and DD is the day of the month between 01 and 31. It may also have an optional time portion given in the ISO 8601 recommended primary standard notation: HH:MM:SS.sss where HH is the number of complete hours that have passed since midnight (00-24), MM is the number of complete minutes that have passed since the start of the hour (00-59), and SS is the number of complete seconds since the start of the minute (00-60), and sss are milliseconds that have passed since the start of the second (000-999). Time zones are not allowed so all times are in Universal Time. The time portion must follow the date portion with both portions separated by a "T". For example, "2004-07-29" is July 29, 2004 and "2004-07-29T12:30:00" is precisely 12:30 on July 29, 2004.
2.6.0	1.1.0	Duration	A duration of time. A time value given in the ISO 8601 recommended primary standard notation: PTHH:MM:SS.sss where PT are tokens to indicate that the time value is a duration, HH is the number of complete hours that have passed since midnight (00-24), MM is the number of complete minutes that have passed since the start of the hour (00-59), and SS is the number of complete seconds since the start of the minute (00-60), and sss are milliseconds that have passed since the start of the second (000-999).
2.6.0	1.1.0	Enumeration	Value is selected from a list of allowed values. The name of list is an additional attribute of the element. Lists may be externally controlled in which case the location of the list is indicated in the textual definition of the element.
2.6.0	2.6.0	FloatSequence	A list of floating point numbers where the order of the values is fixed. A space separates each value. For example, "1.2 3.4 5.6".
2.6.0	2.2.3	ID	SPASE Identifier
2.6.0	1.1.0	Item	An element which is a value for an enumerated list.
2.6.0	1.1.0	Numeric	A fractional number which can be expressed in scientific notation. The string "NaN" represents not-a-number (flag) values and the string "INF" represents an infinitely large value. The value "-INF" represents an infinitely small value.
2.6.0	1.2.0	Sequence	A list of whole number values where the order of the values is fixed. A space separates each value. For example, "1 2 3".
2.6.0	2.6.0	StringSequence	A list of strings where the order of the values is fixed. A space separates each value. For example, "one two three".
2.6.0	1.1.0	Text	A string of alphanumeric characters. A text based "markup" is supported. See the "Text Mark-up" section in specification document for complete details.
2.6.0	1.3.1	URL	Universal Resource Locator
2.6.0	2.6.0	Value	A description of the standardized measurement increments in which a value is specified. The description is represented as a mathematical phrase. Units should be represented by widely accepted representation. For example, units should conform to the International System of Units (SI) which is maintained by BIPM (Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (see http://www.bipm.fr/ ) when appropriate or use tokens like "Re" to represent units of the Radius of the Earth. Within a phrase the circumflex (^) is used to indicate a power, a star (*) is used to indicate multiplication and a slash (/) division. When symbols are not separated by a mathematical operator, multiplication is assumed. Symbols for base units can be found at: http://www.bipm.fr/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-1/#symbols and those for common derived units can be found at: http://www.bipm.fr/en/si/derived_units/2-2-2.html
