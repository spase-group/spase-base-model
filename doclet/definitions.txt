The value associated with an element must be one of the following:

<b>Container</b>
: An element that is a container of other elements. If "Container" is 
specified the element must have sub-elements specified. When a container element 
is used no value is assigned to the element. All values are contained within the 
sub-elements.

<b>Numeric</b>
: An element that has a value which is a real number expressed in base 10.  

<b>Date</b>
: An element that has a value which is a date. A date is given in the ISO 
8601 recommended primary standard notation: YYYY-MM-DD. where YYYY is the year 
in the Gregorian calendar, MM is the month of the year between 01 
(January) and 12 (December), and DD is the day of the month between 01 and 31. 
It may also have an optional time portion (See Time). The time portion must 
follow the date portion with both portions separated by a "T". For example, 
"2004-07-29" is July 29, 2004 and "2004-07-29T12:30:00" is precisely 12:30 on 
July 29, 2004.

<b>Enumeration</b>
: An element that has a value selected from a list of values. The 
list to use is indicated in the definition. For example, "Enumerates - see 
Project List" indicates only values found in the "Project List" may be assigned 
to this element.

<b>Count</b>
: An element that has a value which is a base 10 integer number.

<b>Item</b>
: An element which indicates a state or existence of an attribute. An item 
is valueless. An item may not contain other elements, but could have attributes. 
An item may also be an member of an enumerated list.

<b>Text</b>
: An element that has a value which is a sequence of characters. 
The number of characters may be limited and is indicated in the definition. A text may have 
a formation rule. If so this is indicated in the definition.
